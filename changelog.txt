v0.4b   - (April 25, 2023)
          * FIXED: The first time aviation weather runs, it deletes some temp files that contain weather info... it was trying to delete files
            that didn't exist, and complained.  Fixed this.

v0.3b   - (February 23, 2023)
          * ADDED: Some visualizations during the back and forth with APIs to determine locale, lat/long and weather data, just to give you
            some more info during the troubleshooting process incase something hangs or is blocked.

v0.2b   - (February 21, 2023)
          * ADDED: I incorporated a new option that lets you pick between the current US-based weather service, as well as a Global weather
            service. I found another API that lets you pull global weather info without the need of an API key, however each has their plusses
            and minuses.  US-based weather is a only 3-day forecast, but has a user-friendly expanded forecast, but it gives much more richer
            content.  The global-based weather is a 7-day forecast, does not have expanded weather, and uses more of the standard data elements.
            The global weather does give you an option between using Imperial or Metric units of measurement, found in the config menu.
          * CHANGED: Made a big change in the aviation weather service, and will no longer need an API key to retrieve the METAR/TAF information.
            You can still enable/disable the aviation weather, and pick your preferred station/airport. This *should* work globally.  Please let
            me know if you run into any problems, and I will dive into it!

v0.1b   - (February 8, 2023)
          * RELEASE: Initial release to the masses... enjoy, while I work out any last minute bugs before a release candidate is made available.
